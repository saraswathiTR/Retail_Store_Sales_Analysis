📊 Retail Store Sales Analysis (Excel)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail transaction data to understand sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and business trends using Microsoft Excel.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Excel can be used as a business analytics tool, not just for calculations, by transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights through pivot tables, charts, and dashboards.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains retail transaction records from 2022 to 2024, including product, payment, discount, and channel information.

Key Columns:

Transaction_ID – Unique identifier for each transaction

Customer_ID – Unique customer identifier

Category – Product category

Item – Item code/name

Price_Per_Unit – Price of a single unit

Quantity – Quantity purchased

Total_Spent – Total transaction value

Payment_Method – Cash / Credit Card / Digital Wallet

Location – Online / In-store

Transaction_Date – Date of transaction

Discount_Applied – TRUE / FALSE

📌 The dataset intentionally contains real-world issues such as inconsistent values and pre-calculated totals, which were handled during analysis.

Discount Impact Analysis

Revenue by Discount Status

The dashboard is designed to allow quick decision-making by management.

🔍 Key Insights

Revenue shows an overall upward trend, peaking in 2024.

Certain product categories (e.g., Butchers and Electric Household Essentials) contribute significantly more to total revenue.

Online sales generate higher revenue compared to in-store sales.

Discounted transactions have higher transaction volume, suggesting discounts encourage purchases, though profitability analysis would require cost data.

⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations

Each transaction represents a single order.

Customer repeat behavior analysis was not performed as customer IDs are unique.

Profitability analysis could not be conducted due to the absence of cost data.

Some values (e.g., discount status marked as unknown) were handled using reasonable assumptions for analysis.
